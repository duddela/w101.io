    Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or
    /ˌwɪki-/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ee-) is a free content, multilingual
    online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteer
    contributors through a model of open collaboration, using a wiki-based
    editing system. It is the largest and most-read reference work in
    history,[3] and consistently one of the 15 most popular websites ranked by
    Alexa; as of 2021, Wikipedia was ranked the 13th most popular site.[3][4] It
    carries no advertisements and is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an
    American non-profit organization funded mainly through small donations.[5]
    Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales[6] and Larry
    Sanger; Sanger coined its name as a blending of "wiki" and
    "encyclopedia".[7][8] Initially available only in English, versions in other
    languages were quickly developed. Its combined editions comprise more than
    57 million articles, attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per
    month, and more than 17 million edits per month (1.9 edits per
    second).[9][10]

    Wikipedia has received praise for its enablement of the democratization of
    knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced amount
    of commercial bias, but criticism for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly
    gender bias against women and alleged ideological bias.[11][12] Its
    reliability was frequently criticized in the 2000s, but has improved over
    time and has been generally praised in the late 2010s and early
    2020s.[13][3][11] Its coverage of controversial topics such as American
    politics and major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic has received
    substantial media attention. It has been censored by world governments,
    ranging from specific pages to the entire site. It has become an element of
    popular culture, with references in books, films and academic studies. In
    2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake
    news by suggesting fact-checking links to related Wikipedia
    articles.[14][15]
